# Weather Forecasting Project

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast weather conditions based on historical data.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mminuwaali/weather-forecasting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-forecasting
   ```
   
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    # linux and max
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
